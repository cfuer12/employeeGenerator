# employeeGenerator
Creating summaries for a employee roster form by using node to produce an HTML webpage.

In this project, we needed to create a line application that can generate a team based out of Managers, Engineers and Interns. The app is basically consisted of using node.JS and node.CLI in order to make this generator work. The end result would allow a user to use terminal with the JavaScript file and answer a series of prompted questions. 

The questions will allow them to input the required ammount of people they want to add to this Employee Summary page. 

Inquirer and Jest was needed in order to run the node program through the terminal, so the use of npm install in the termianl was needed in order to have the application working properly. I also had to create a .gitignore file to ignore the large node_modules file that would be thrown at us. In the "lib" file, I needed to create seperate JS files that would input the info needed from each person into the then generated HTML file. 

Test were also ran on this app to see if each JS file would pass by using npm run test, in which they seem to have. I was at first struggling with having them pass the first time around as I was missing syntax and mispelling a few words in the code. After finding out and reviewing it over and over, it all started to work just fine and pass.
